    <h1>Prevention</h1>
    <p>As COVID-19 has become a serious issue lately so we need to maintain some rules to keep safe ourselves from this virus. To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:<br><br>
    → Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.<br><br>
    → Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.<br><br>
    → Avoid touching your face, eyes or mouth.<br><br>
    → Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.<br><br>
    → Stay home if you feel unwell.<br><br>
    → Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.<br><br>
    → Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.<br><br>
    → If you have a fever, a cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance.<br><br>
    → Follow the directions of your local health authority.<br><br><p2><b>[ Source: <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_2 ">WHO</a> ]</b></p2><br><br></p>
